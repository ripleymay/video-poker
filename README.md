# Video Poker

Now you can play outside the casino - or in *Ripley's Casino* rather! Video poker is a single player game usually played on a machine (similar to slots). The game has grown very popular since it's creation in 1970, and it's perfect as an approachable introduction to poker for a novice player.  

There's many different versions of the game, but one of the simplest and most common - and the one you'll play here - is *Jacks or Better*, where the lowest ranking winning hand is a pair of Jacks or better (Queen, King, Ace).


## Getting started

The game is relatively simple - you place a bet of 1 to 5 credits, then you are dealt five cards. You can hold any or all of those cards, then draw again to replace the ones you did not hold. After you draw, those 5 cards are evaluated for a winning poker hand, and you recieve the equivalent credits based on how much you bet and the rank of your winning hand. If you have no wins, you lose your bet. The game ends when the player runs out of credits.

It's helpful to review winning poker hands, although the names of them are displayed in the browser.

## Next steps

As of now, the player automatically starts with 50 credits, but it would be preferable to have them select their starting amount. It would also be nice to add some more flair to the page when the player wins - i.e. a sound effect or a blinking hand name on the win table. The game could also be formatted to fit phone screens slightly better. 

Ideally, the player could choose to *actually* pay for credits AND cash out, so the stakes of winning and losing would be a bit higher!
